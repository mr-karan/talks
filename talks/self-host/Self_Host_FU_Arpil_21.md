# Networking

- Tailscale for Mesh Network
    - Based on Wireguard VPN.
    - Authenticated sessions only.
    - Expose services on RPi easily without any static IP.

- Tailscale uses `100.64.0.0/10` subnet from the Carrier Grade NAT space.

---

# Networking

## Dont expose to the world

```s
doggo pihole.mrkaran.dev
NAME                    TYPE    CLASS   TTL     ADDRESS         NAMESERVER        
pihole.mrkaran.dev.     A       IN      300s    100.119.138.27  100.119.138.27:53
```

## unless required

```s
doggo git.mrkaran.dev       
NAME                    TYPE    CLASS   TTL     ADDRESS         NAMESERVER        
git.mrkaran.dev.        A       IN      300s    104.21.7.168    100.119.138.27:53
git.mrkaran.dev.        A       IN      300s    172.67.187.239  100.119.138.27:53
```

# Networking

- Caddy as a proxy for all services.
    - Running 2 instances of Caddy.
        - Private: Listens on Tailscale Interface.
        - Public: Listens on DO's public IPv4 Interface.

    - Automatic SSL with ACME DNS challenge
        - Built my own image: https://github.com/mr-karan/caddy-plugins-docker

---

# Storage

- DONT use RPi for storage.
    - Atleast not with SD cards.
    - Newer RPis can boot off SSDs.

- Enable snapshots for volumes provided by cloud provider.

- Use separate DB instances for different applications.

---

# Storage

![bg 90%](./img/shynet-blog.png)

---

# Storage

- Use separate DB instances for different applications.


- Traffic spike in the blog
    - Shynet requires more resources
    - Server upgrade was done abruptly
    - Postgres required a WAL Log Reset to start

---

# Backups

- Restic
    - Periodic Job in Nomad.
    - Single vault with everything inside `/data`.
    - All applications mount inside `/data` folder.
    - Upload to Backblaze B2.

---

# Security

- If it should not be public facing, don't expose to WWW.
    - Prefer to use a VPN or mesh network instead of IP whitelists.
    - Tighter Firewall rules otherwise.

- Pi-Hole, Gitea, etc Admin interfaces must always be protected with strong passwords.

- Periodic updates to App and OS.

---

# Takeaways

- Don't overthink. Pick something really simple (like Pi-hole) and host it.
    - You'll feel pretty happy about it.

- Don't blindly copy/paste this stack.
    - Took me 2 years of constant iteration and experimentation.
    - KISS.
